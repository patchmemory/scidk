acceptance:
- A README-ready snippet exists covering enabling rclone provider, GUI usage, and API endpoints.
- Quickstart covers installing rclone, configuring popular providers (Drive/Dropbox/S3), verification commands, and troubleshooting.
- Docs explain both direct Rclone provider flow and optional FUSE mount flow with safe defaults.
- Links to systemd template and mount commands are provided in dev/ (not necessarily in README yet).
demo_steps:
- Follow the quickstart to configure one remote (e.g., Google Drive) and verify with `rclone ls`.
- Enable provider (SCIDK_PROVIDERS=local_fs,mounted_fs,rclone) and browse/scan in GUI.
- Optionally mount remote read-only under data/ and scan via Local Filesystem provider.
