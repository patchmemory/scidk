### Story 3: The Literature-to-Bench Connection
**As a researcher comparing my data to published work**  
**I want to** instantly see how my results relate to the literature  
**So that I** can validate findings and identify novel discoveries  

#### The Experience:

**Postdoc Maria (3:30 PM)**: *"How does our gut microbiome profile compare to published anti-PD1 responder signatures?"*

**SciDK connects data to literature**:
```
Comparing your OTU data to published signatures:

üìä YOUR DATA vs. PUBLISHED SIGNATURES:

Matching "Anti-PD1 Responder" Signatures:
1. Gopalakrishnan et al. 2018 (Science)
   - Similarity: 72% (based on genus-level composition)
   - Key overlap: ‚Üë Akkermansia, ‚Üë Faecalibacterium
   - Missing in your data: Ruminococcus (not detected)
   
2. Jin et al. 2019 (Nat Med)
   - Similarity: 81% (best match!)
   - Both show Bacteroides/Prevotella ratio >1.5

üß¨ TAXONOMIC DEEP DIVE:
Your Akkermansia muciniphila (OTU_00034):
- Abundance: 8.3% (responders), 0.4% (non-responders)
- 99.2% identity to NCBI Reference NR_074436.1
- Also elevated in 3 other MIT studies:
  ‚Ä¢ Smith Lab 2023: Checkpoint inhibitor study
  ‚Ä¢ Jones Lab 2024: CAR-T response correlation
  [View Phylogenetic Tree] [BLAST Against MIT Database]

üí° SUGGESTED NEXT STEPS:

### Story 5: The New Lab Member Onboarding
**As a new postdoc joining a lab**  
**I want to** quickly understand what work has been done before  
**So that I** can build on existing knowledge from day one  

#### The Experience:

**New Postdoc Alex (Day 3)**: *"What lung cancer work has been done in this lab? What methods worked best?"*

**SciDK provides institutional memory**:
```
Lab History: Lung Cancer Research (2019-2024)

üìö KNOWLEDGE SUMMARY:
‚Ä¢ 12 completed projects, 487 experiments total
‚Ä¢ 3 published papers, 2 in preparation
‚Ä¢ 1,247 GB data archived, all searchable

üèÜ SUCCESSFUL PROTOCOLS:
1. Orthotopic injection (Laura's optimization)
   - Success rate improved from 45% ‚Üí 94%
   - Key: Use 30G needle, inject slowly (30 seconds)
   - See video: Laura_injection_technique_2023.mp4

2. MicroCT tumor detection
   - Optimal: Day 7, 14, 21 post-injection
   - Settings: 90kV, 88¬µA, 0.5mm Al filter
   - Analysis pipeline: /shared/scripts/tumor_segmentation_v3.py

‚ùå WHAT DIDN'T WORK (save time!):
‚Ä¢ Subcutaneous model: Poor translation to human
‚Ä¢ Daily imaging: Too stressful for mice, affected growth
‚Ä¢ Protocol v1.0 cell prep: 60% viability (v2.0: 95%)

üë• EXPERT CONTACTS:
‚Ä¢ Laura M: Orthotopic injections, imaging (last active: today)
‚Ä¢ Dr. Chen: CRISPR screens (moved to Stanford, happy to help)
‚Ä¢ Milton: MicroCT wizard (office: Room 76-553)

üìÇ STARTING RESOURCES:
[Download Starter Pack] [View Training Videos] [Shadow Laura Next Week]
```

**Value**: Alex achieves in 3 days what usually takes 3 months of knowledge gathering.

### Story 6: The Core Facility Intelligence Amplification
**As a core facility manager**  
**I want to** turn my expertise into searchable institutional knowledge  
**So that** users get answers instantly and I can focus on complex problems  

#### The Experience:

**Milton, MicroCT Specialist**: *"SciDK, someone's asking about imaging lung tumors in black mice. What's worked before?"*

**SciDK leverages facility knowledge**:
```
Imaging Black Mice: Facility Knowledge Base

üî¨ PREVIOUS CASES (3 similar):
1. Project MIT_2022_187 (Dr. Kim's lab)
   - Challenge: Poor contrast in C57BL/6 mice
   - Solution: Increased exposure time 3x, adjusted kV to 70
   - Result: Successfully imaged 24 mice
   
2. Project MIT_2023_045 (Dr. Patel's lab)
   - Used contrast agent: Fenestra VC
   - Timing: Inject 2hr before imaging
   - Dose: 0.1 mL per 25g body weight

üìã RECOMMENDED PROTOCOL:
For black mice (C57BL/6) lung tumors:
‚Ä¢ Settings: 70kV, 114¬µA, 1mm Al filter
‚Ä¢ Exposure: 3x standard (300ms vs 100ms)
‚Ä¢ Consider contrast agent for tumors <2mm
‚Ä¢ Book extra time slot (45min vs standard 15min)

üí° MILTON'S NOTES (auto-extracted):
"Black mice absorb more X-rays due to melanin in skin.
Compensate with longer exposure or contrast agent.
Never had success with tumors <1mm without contrast."

üìä SUCCESS METRICS:
‚Ä¢ 87% successful tumor detection with this protocol
‚Ä¢ Average tumor size detected: 1.8mm
‚Ä¢ 28 successful projects using this approach

[Generate Protocol PDF] [Book Extended Session] [Order Contrast Agent]
```

**Value**: Milton's expertise becomes institutional infrastructure, available 24/7.

## Plugin Developer Story

### Story 7: The Staff Scientist as Plugin Developer
**As a staff scientist with domain expertise**  
**I want to** create a plugin for my facility without deep programming knowledge  
**So that** our specialized data integrates with the institute's SciDK  

#### The Experience:

**Dr. Alex, Mass Spec Facility (Monday morning)**:

```bash
# Step 1: Create plugin from template (2 minutes)
$ scidk create-plugin mass-spec-core
> Plugin display name: Mass Spectrometry Core
> Your GitHub username: alex-scientist
> Data types: proteomics, metabolomics
‚úÖ Created: scidk-plugin-mass-spec-core/

# Step 2: Open in Cursor AI editor
$ cd scidk-plugin-mass-spec-core
$ cursor .
```

**In Cursor, Alex writes a comment**:
```python
# TODO: Parse MaxQuant output files with protein IDs, abundance, and link to UniProt
```

**Cursor AI generates the complete parser code**:
```python
def parse_maxquant(self, filepath: Path) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Parse MaxQuant proteinGroups.txt output"""
    df = pd.read_csv(filepath, sep='\t')
    
    proteins = []
    for _, row in df.iterrows():
        protein = {
            'protein_id': row.get('Protein IDs', ''),
            'gene_name': row.get('Gene names', ''),
            'uniprot_id': self._extract_uniprot_id(row.get('Protein IDs', '')),
            'sequence_coverage': row.get('Sequence coverage [%]', 0),
            'unique_peptides': row.get('Unique peptides', 0)
        }
        if protein['unique_peptides'] >= 2:  # Standard threshold
            proteins.append(protein)
    
    return {'proteins': proteins}
```

**30 minutes later, the plugin is working**:
- ‚úÖ Parses facility's data formats
- ‚úÖ Connects to knowledge graph
- ‚úÖ Handles natural language queries
- ‚úÖ Links to UniProt automatically

**User can now ask**: *"Show proteins identified in yesterday's mass spec run"*

**Value**: Alex creates in half a day what would have taken weeks of development.
